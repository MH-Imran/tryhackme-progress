# What Is a Network? – TryHackMe Notes


This is my first room from the “Network Fundamentals” module. I kept my notes simple so I can come back to them quickly.

---

## What I Learned
- A network is basically a way for devices to talk to each other.
- Devices can share information, resources, or services through connections.
- Networks can be small (home network) or huge (the internet).
- Every device needs an identifier (an IP address) to communicate.

---

## Key Points (In My Own Words)
- The internet is just a giant network of many smaller networks.
- Networks help computers share files, send messages, and access websites.
- Without networks, security monitoring wouldn’t exist — no logs, no traffic, nothing to analyze.

---

## Why This Matters for SOC Work
Understanding what a network actually is makes it easier to understand:
- how attackers move from one device to another  
- why logs are generated  
- how traffic flows  
- what “normal” communication looks like  

All of this becomes important later in detection and investigation.

Very basic room, but it sets the foundation for everything that comes next.
