# Linux Fundamentals (Part 1) - TryHackMe Notes

**Module:** Pre-Security → Linux Fundamentals

These are my personal notes from “Linux Fundamentals Part 1.”  
Even though I have been using Kali for a long time and this room helped me organize the basics in my head and understand how Linux is structured underneath.

---

## What I Learned (in my own words)

### Linux is built differently from Windows
One thing that clicked for me is how Linux treats *everything as a file* — from text documents to devices.  
It feels strange at first, but once you understand it, Linux becomes way more predictable.

### The filesystem has a clean, logical layout
This room made me look again at the Linux directory structure:

- **/home** → where users store their stuff  
- **/etc** → configuration files  
- **/bin** & **/sbin** → essential system commands  
- **/var** → logs and data that constantly change  
- **/root** → home folder for the root user  

I already knew most of this from using Kali, but this time it made more sense *why* things are organized this way.

### Commands feel more meaningful when you know where you are
Working with:


```bash
ls
cd
pwd
```

# Linux Fundamentals (Part 2) - TryHackMe Notes


I finished Part 2 of the Linux Fundamentals module today, and honestly this one felt more “hands-on” compared to Part 1.  
A lot of things I already knew from using Kali before, but going through them slowly helped me understand *why* these commands work the way they do.

---

## What I Learned (written in my own style)

### • Working with files the “Linux way”
I’ve always used `cat` and moved on, but this room made me actually try:

- `less` when the file is too long  
- `head` and `tail` to quickly peek at the beginning or end  
- `wc` to count things without scrolling forever  
- `grep` to find exactly what I need  

It sounds simple, but using these properly makes Linux feel much easier to control.

### • Pipes finally make sense
I knew what pipes were, but I didn’t realize how useful they are until I started chaining commands like:

```bash
journalctl | grep failed
ls -l /var/log | wc -l
cat something.txt | grep error 
```

# Linux Fundamentals (Part 3) - TryHackMe Notes


I finished Part 3 of the Linux Fundamentals module today. This one felt a bit heavier than the first two parts because it covered a bunch of small, but important tools that you end up using all the time in Linux.Some of the things I already knew but going through them slowly helped me understand them better instead of just using them out of the habit.

---

## What I Learned (in my own words)

### • Archiving and Compressing Files
I’ve used `.zip` and `.tar` before, but I never really paid attention to how they work.  
This room made me actually use:

- `tar`
- `gzip`
- `gunzip`

It was helpful to see the difference between archiving and compressing instead of mixing them up like before.

### • More Work with Permissions
Permissions started to make more sense when I actually changed them and saw how files behaved.  
Numbers like `755` and `644` no longer feel random — I can now “see” why a script runs or doesn’t run based on permissions.

### • Regular Expressions (basic intro)
I’m not great at regex yet, but the examples showed me how useful it is for searching through text.  
Even simple patterns helped me understand how logs can be filtered or matched.

### • Environment Variables
This part explained why variables like `$PATH` matter.  
I always ignored them before, but now I understand how they affect which commands run and where Linux looks for executables.

### • A Small Taste of Scripting
At the end there was a simple intro to bash scripting.  
Nothing too advanced, but enough for me to see how useful even a small script can be for repeating tasks.

tar
gzip
gunzip
chmod
chown
echo
