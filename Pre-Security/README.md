# Pre-Security (THM)

I created this folder to keep my **TryHackMe Pre-Security** notes in one place. I finished the Pre-Security path, and I also want a clean structure so I can continue adding my **SOC Level 1** progress without mixing everything together.

This repo is mainly for my own learning, but I’m keeping it organized so I can quickly review topics when I need them.

---

## What you’ll find here
- Short notes from rooms/modules I completed
- Key terms and concepts I want to remember
- Commands or examples I used during the labs
- Quick summaries in my own words (not copy-pasted)

---

## How I’m using this folder
- Each file = one room/module (or one study day)
- Notes stay simple and practical
- If something confuses me, I’ll write it down and revisit later

---

## Next step
I’m now moving into **TryHackMe SOC Level 1**, and I’ll be storing that progress in a separate folder so it stays easy to track.

Learning in progress, one step at a time.
