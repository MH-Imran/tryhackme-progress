# Introduction to Cyber Security – My Notes

I finished the “Introduction to Cyber Security” module on TryHackMe today.  
Instead of writing something too formal, I’m just keeping a few notes in my own words so I can look back later.

This was basically my first real step into cybersecurity, so most of the content felt new, but in a good way.

## What I actually learned

- what cybersecurity means in a practical sense  
- different kinds of threats (malware, phishing, ransomware, social engineering — those kinds of things)  
- how attackers usually think and what pushes them  
- how systems and networks get exposed to risk  
- the whole CIA triad thing and why it matters for security  
- the idea of “attack vectors” and how people take advantage of them  
- different security roles, especially SOC work

Nothing too deep yet, but it gave me a solid idea of the overall landscape.

## My personal takeaways

Honestly, the biggest thing I understood is that cybersecurity isn’t only about tools or commands.  
It’s more about knowing how things fail — and why.  
Most attacks don’t happen because someone used some crazy exploit. They happen because a small mistake or bad habit opens the door.

Also, learning about threat actors was interesting.  
Not everybody does cyber attacks for the same reason. Some want money, some want fame, some want political impact.

## Stuff I found interesting

- Real-life breach stories — makes everything feel more “real”  
- How one tiny weakness can cause a huge incident  
- How SOC teams work together and respond to alerts

## Things I want to revisit later

- more about different malware types  
- how vulnerabilities are found  
- incident response steps, but deeper than the basic explanation in this module

This module didn’t make me a cybersecurity expert or anything, but it gave me the foundation I needed before getting into the technical parts.
