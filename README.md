# TryHackMe Progress

I’m using this repository to track my learning on TryHackMe as I work toward becoming a SOC analyst.

This repo mainly exists for my own learning and consistency, but it also helps me document how my understanding improves over time — especially around areas that matter in real SOC work.

## What I keep here
As I complete rooms and modules, I add:
- Short notes in my own words
- Commands or steps I want to remember
- Small explanations of concepts that were new to me
- Observations that felt important from a security point of view

I try to keep things simple and honest rather than overly polished.

## Current focus
I’ve completed the **Pre-Security path**, which helped me build a foundation in:
- Windows fundamentals and basic logging
- Networking concepts and traffic behavior
- Linux basics from a security perspective
- Core cybersecurity ideas

My current focus is moving beyond theory into:
- Windows log analysis
- Network traffic investigation
- SOC-oriented hands-on practice

## Notes
Some notes may be brief or incomplete. This is intentional — the goal is learning, not perfection.

More updates will be added as I continue working through new rooms.
