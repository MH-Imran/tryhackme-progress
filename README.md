# TryHackMe Progress

I'm using this repo to keep track of my TryHackMe learning as I work through different rooms related to SOC analysis, networking, Linux, and general cybersecurity.

I’ll be adding:
- short notes from rooms I complete  
- screenshots of my progress (later)  
- commands or steps I want to remember  
- small explanations in my own words  

This is mainly for my own learning, but it also helps me stay consistent and organized.

More updates will come as I complete new rooms.
