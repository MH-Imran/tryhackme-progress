# Windows Fundamentals (Part 1) - Tryhackme Notes

## Why I started with this
Before going deeper into SOC tools and logs, I wanted to properly understand how Windows works at a basic level.  
Since most organizations use Windows, it makes sense to know how users, files, and processes behave in a normal system.

These are my personal notes from completing **Windows Fundamentals – Part 1** on TryHackMe.



## How I now think about Windows
I used to think of Windows just as an operating system people use daily.  
After this module, I started seeing it as a system that constantly records activity — which is very useful for security monitoring.

Almost everything happening in Windows leaves some kind of trace.



## Users and accounts
- Windows uses user accounts to separate access between people.
- Each user has their own profile and permissions.
- Admin accounts are especially sensitive because they can do almost anything.
- From a security perspective, unusual login behavior should always be investigated.

This helped me understand why failed logins and account changes are such common SOC alerts.



## Groups and permissions
- Users are placed into groups, and groups define what users are allowed to do.
- I learned that attackers often try to abuse group membership instead of exploiting software.
- If a normal user suddenly becomes an admin, that’s a serious red flag.

This part made me realize how important permission monitoring is.



## Processes
- A process is basically a running program.
- Every time you open an application, a process is created.
- Malware can hide by pretending to be a normal process.
- Knowing what “normal” looks like makes it easier to spot something suspicious.

I also learned that processes often have parent-child relationships, which can reveal attacker behavior.



## Windows filesystem basics
- The main system drive is usually `C:\`.
- Important folders include:
  - `C:\Windows`
  - `C:\Users`
  - `C:\Program Files`
- Attackers often place files inside user folders or temporary locations.
- File location matters a lot during investigations.

I didn’t realize before how much context file paths can give during an incident.



## Why this matters for SOC work
This module helped me understand why Windows is such a big focus in SOC environments:
- Most alerts are related to user activity or processes.
- Knowing the basics makes later log analysis much easier.
- It builds the foundation for SIEM and detection work.

# Windows Fundamentals (Part 2) - Tryhackme Notes

## Why this part was important to me
After learning the basics in Part 1, I wanted to understand how Windows actually records what’s happening on the system.  
This is where **Windows Fundamentals Part 2** becomes very relevant for SOC analysts.

Most real investigations rely on logs, not guesses.



## Windows event logs
- Windows keeps detailed records of system activity using event logs.
- These logs include:
  - Logins and logouts
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Process execution
  - System and service changes
- These logs are often forwarded to SIEM platforms in real environments.

This made it clear why SOC analysts spend so much time looking at logs.



## Event Viewer
- Event Viewer is the built-in tool to view Windows logs.
- Logs are grouped into categories like:
  - Security
  - System
  - Application
- Security logs are especially important when investigating attacks.

I realized that understanding where logs come from is just as important as reading them.



## Processes and services (security angle)
- Services run in the background and often start automatically.
- Malware sometimes installs itself as a service to stay persistent.
- A service running under an unusual account should raise suspicion.

This part helped me connect Windows behavior to real attacker techniques.



## Windows registry (first exposure)
- The registry stores configuration data for the system and applications.
- Attackers frequently modify the registry to maintain persistence.
- Even small registry changes can indicate malicious activity.

At this stage, I don’t understand every registry key — but I now know *why* it matters.



## Why this matters for SOC and SIEM
- SIEM tools rely heavily on Windows event logs.
- Many detections are based on:
  - Event IDs
  - Authentication activity
  - Process creation
  - Service modifications
- Understanding Windows internals makes alerts less confusing.

This module helped me feel more confident about moving into SOC-level labs.



## What I plan to do next
- Complete Windows Fundamentals Part 3
- Practice checking logs directly using Event Viewer and PowerShell
- Start correlating Windows activity with MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Apply this knowledge in SOC and SIEM exercises

# Windows Fundamentals (Part 3) - Tryhackme Notes

## Why I studied this part
After completing Parts 1 and 2, I wanted to go deeper into how Windows handles security internally.  
**Windows Fundamentals Part 3** focuses more on security controls and protections, which are very relevant for SOC analysts.

This part helped me understand not just *what* Windows does, but *how it tries to protect itself*.



## Windows security features
Windows includes several built-in security mechanisms that work together to reduce risk.

Some key ideas I learned:
- Security is layered, not dependent on one control
- Even if one layer fails, others can still help
- Many SOC alerts are triggered when these protections are bypassed or disabled

This changed how I think about “normal” vs “suspicious” system behavior.



## User Account Control (UAC)
- UAC is designed to prevent unauthorized changes to the system
- Even admin users don’t run with full privileges all the time
- Malware often tries to bypass or disable UAC

From a SOC perspective, unexpected privilege escalation attempts are worth investigating.



## Windows Defender & built-in protections
- Windows Defender provides real-time protection
- It monitors files, processes, and behavior
- Disabling or tampering with Defender can be a strong indicator of malicious activity

I realized that alerts related to Defender are often high-priority in SOC environments.



## Firewall basics
- Windows Firewall controls inbound and outbound network traffic
- Rules define which traffic is allowed or blocked
- Attackers may try to modify firewall rules to allow malicious communication

Firewall changes are important signals when investigating potential compromises.



## BitLocker and data protection
- BitLocker is used to encrypt disks
- It protects data if a device is stolen or lost
- Encryption status matters in enterprise security policies

This helped me understand why SOC teams also care about *data protection*, not just attacks.



## Why this matters for SOC analysts
This part connected Windows features directly to SOC work:
- Security tools generate logs that SOC analysts investigate
- Changes to security settings often indicate attacker activity
- Understanding built-in protections helps distinguish real threats from noise

It also made it clear why many alerts reference Windows security components.



## What I plan to do next
- Practice analyzing Windows security-related logs
- Learn common Windows-related MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Combine Windows logs with network data for investigations
- Use this knowledge in SOC-focused labs and SIEM tools
