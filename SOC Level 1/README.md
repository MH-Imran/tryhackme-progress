# SOC Level 1 (TryHackMe)

I made this folder to track my progress through **TryHackMe’s SOC Level 1** path.  
My goal is not to “finish fast” — I’m using this path to build real SOC habits: reading alerts/logs, forming a conclusion, and writing down what I learned in a way I can review later.

This folder is basically my learning log as I move from fundamentals into SOC-style investigation thinking.

---

## What you’ll find here
- **Daily/room notes** (what I learned, what confused me, what I need to review)
- **Key commands / filters** (things I actually used, not theory)
- **Mini investigation takeaways** (how I would think about it in a real SOC ticket)

I’m keeping everything short and practical so it stays useful.

---

## My approach (how I’m studying)
- One room/section at a time (steady pace)
- Notes written in my own words
- If I don’t understand something, I write it down and revisit it later instead of pretending I understood it

---

## File naming style
Examples:
- `soc-level1-day1-notes.md`
- `soc-level1-day2-notes.md`
- `soc-level1-day3-notes.md`

(Each file is one study session.)

---

## What I’m trying to improve
- Alert triage mindset (what matters vs noise)
- Basic log correlation (Windows logs + network evidence)
- Clear conclusions (normal vs suspicious) without overthinking

---

## Note
This is a learning folder. Everything here is written while I’m still training and improving, so the notes may evolve as I get better.
