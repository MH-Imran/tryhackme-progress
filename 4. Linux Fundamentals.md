# Linux Fundamentals – Part 1 - TryHackMe Notes

**Module:** Pre-Security → Linux Fundamentals

These are my personal notes from “Linux Fundamentals Part 1.”  
Even though I have been using Kali for a long time and this room helped me organize the basics in my head and understand how Linux is structured underneath.

---

## What I Learned (in my own words)

### Linux is built differently from Windows
One thing that clicked for me is how Linux treats *everything as a file* — from text documents to devices.  
It feels strange at first, but once you understand it, Linux becomes way more predictable.

### The filesystem has a clean, logical layout
This room made me look again at the Linux directory structure:

- **/home** → where users store their stuff  
- **/etc** → configuration files  
- **/bin** & **/sbin** → essential system commands  
- **/var** → logs and data that constantly change  
- **/root** → home folder for the root user  

I already knew most of this from using Kali, but this time it made more sense *why* things are organized this way.

### Commands feel more meaningful when you know where you are
Working with:


```bash
ls
cd
pwd
```
