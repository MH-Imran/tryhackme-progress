# Linux Fundamentals (Part 1) - TryHackMe Notes

**Module:** Pre-Security → Linux Fundamentals

These are my personal notes from “Linux Fundamentals Part 1.”  
Even though I have been using Kali for a long time and this room helped me organize the basics in my head and understand how Linux is structured underneath.

---

## What I Learned (in my own words)

### Linux is built differently from Windows
One thing that clicked for me is how Linux treats *everything as a file* — from text documents to devices.  
It feels strange at first, but once you understand it, Linux becomes way more predictable.

### The filesystem has a clean, logical layout
This room made me look again at the Linux directory structure:

- **/home** → where users store their stuff  
- **/etc** → configuration files  
- **/bin** & **/sbin** → essential system commands  
- **/var** → logs and data that constantly change  
- **/root** → home folder for the root user  

I already knew most of this from using Kali, but this time it made more sense *why* things are organized this way.

### Commands feel more meaningful when you know where you are
Working with:


```bash
ls
cd
pwd
```

# Linux Fundamentals (Part 2) - TryHackMe Notes


I finished Part 2 of the Linux Fundamentals module today, and honestly this one felt more “hands-on” compared to Part 1.  
A lot of things I already knew from using Kali before, but going through them slowly helped me understand *why* these commands work the way they do.

## What I Learned (written in my own style)

### • Working with files the “Linux way”
I’ve always used `cat` and moved on, but this room made me actually try:

- `less` when the file is too long  
- `head` and `tail` to quickly peek at the beginning or end  
- `wc` to count things without scrolling forever  
- `grep` to find exactly what I need  

It sounds simple, but using these properly makes Linux feel much easier to control.

### • Pipes finally make sense
I knew what pipes were, but I didn’t realize how useful they are until I started chaining commands like:

```bash
journalctl | grep failed
ls -l /var/log | wc -l
cat something.txt | grep error 
```
