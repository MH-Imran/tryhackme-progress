# Getting Started on TryHackMe

I'm using this file to keep track of the very beginning of my TryHackMe journey.

So far, I'm focusing on:
- the Pre-Security path  
- basic Linux and networking rooms  
- learning how to read instructions and follow steps properly  

I’ll add more details after I complete rooms and understand things better.  
These notes are mostly for myself and so I don’t forget what I learned in the early days.
